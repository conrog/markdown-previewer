# Markdown Previewer

This project is the solution for the [Markdown Previewer](https://codepen.io/conrog/full/VwWPXWE) challange which can be found the [freeCodeCamp website.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer)

This project imports React, MarkedJS, PrismJS and Babel via CDN Links found in [index.html](/public/index.html). This was done in order to create a React App from scratch and to get familiar with the library without relying on toolchains provided by things such as Create React App via npm.

## Technology Used

- **React**
- **ReactDOM**
- **Babel** to convert JSX syntax.
- **MarkedJS** for parsing mark-up to HTML.
- **PrismJS** provides syntax highlighting for code blocks.

## How to Run

The project was run using the Live Server extension available in Visual Studio Code. This extension launches a local developement server.
